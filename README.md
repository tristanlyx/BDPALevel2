Level 2 Class Materials

## Settup 
* Download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html). Chrome is one of the best browsers for web development. It comes with a set of tools that help you develop a website. You can access Chrome Dev Tools by hitting F12 or through Chrome Hamburger Menu-> More Tools -> Developer Tools. Once you've downloaded chrome, go to any website and try this out. You'll see a lot of cool information about how the site is built. 
* Download [Sublime Text 2] (http://www.sublimetext.com/2). (Click the "Windows 64" download link). Sublime Text 2 is a great (and cool-looking) text editor for building websites with. It's free, but you may see a pop-up from time to time that asks you register your copy. You can ignore this. You are also welcome to use any other editor that you're comfortable with e.g. Notepad++.
* Sign up for [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/). Code Academy offers a simple easy to understand JavaScript tutorial that we'll be making use of. 
* Sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com/join?). That's this website right here. It's used for hosting code and sharing it with other people. 


##2018 TODOs: 
* Add a root level index.html. This is used by students for hosting. (This repos hosting still done on docs/index.html)
* For the how many cabage game, Boolean("false") alwayse returns true. Also "6"==6, so the type conversions aren't going to work how you think in the game. Maybe ignore them.
